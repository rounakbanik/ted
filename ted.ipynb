    "Founded in 1984 by Richard Saulman as a non profit organisation that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design together, TED Conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan and Bill Gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted, which operates under the slogan 'Ideas worth spreading' has managed to achieve an incredible feat of bringing world renowned experts from various walks of life and study and giving them a platform to distill years of their work and research into talks of 18 minutes in length. What's even more incredible is that their invaluable insights is available on the Internet for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the time I begin watching TED Talks in high school, they have never ceased to amaze me. I have learned an incredible amount, about fields I was completely alien to, in the form of poignant stories, breathtaking visuals and subtle humor. So in this notebook, I wanted to attempt at finding insights about the world of TED, its speakers and its viewers and try to answer a few questions that I had always had in the back of my mind."

    "On average, every registered user has favorited close to **11 videos**. \n",

    "\n",

    "We only have data for users that have registered. One of the main incentives for users to register is to keep track of their **favorite videos** and **watch history**. It would be interesting to see if there is a cause-effect relationship here. That is, **only the most active users register since they have an incentive to keep track of their viewership**. It may be the case that the unregistered passive user is in the majority and has viewed a significantly smaller number of talks than the statistics show us."

    "\n",
    "We have gained a lot of insights from the datasets given to us. Let us summarise the most significant results in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are around **12,500** registered users on TED.com and they have favorited their talks close to **135,000** times, with each user favoriting close to **11 talks** on average.\n",
    "2. Ken Robinson's **Do Schools Kill Creativity?** is the most favorited talk of all time.\n",
    "3. Every talk has, on average, close to a **100 comments**.\n",
    "4. There is an obvious correlation between the number of comments and the number of views.\n",
    "5. Talks on **Faith and Religion** attract a significant amount of discussion, debates and comments. Richard Dawkins' talk on **Militant Atheism** is the most commented on talk of all time, despite having only a tenth of the views of Ken Robinson's talk.\n",
    "6. **February** is the most popular month for TED Talks. **November** is the most popular month for great TEDx talks.\n",
    "7. The number of TED Talks have gradually increased since its inception to about **250 talks** being uploaded from the year 2010\n",
    "8. **Hans Rosling** is the most popular TED Speaker, with over **9 appearances**.\n",
    "9. The longest TED Talk was about **6500 words** long. The shortest TED Talk **did not have any words** at all!\n",
    "10. There is **no correlation** between the length and popularity of a TED Talk.\n",
    "11. **Ken Robinson's** talk is the most viewed talk of all time too.\n",
    "12. **Technology** is the most popular theme of TED Talks, followed by **Culture** and **Science**"
